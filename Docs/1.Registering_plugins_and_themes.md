# Registering plugins and themes

You can work with Sense Framework in your WordPress plugins and themes. 

They need to be registered as a Sense Plugin in order to work with the framework. 
That is, a WordPress Theme can be registered as a Sense Plugin but they have some limitations in WordPress like the impossibility of implement [custom pluggable functions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Pluggable_Functions).

There is one special requirement: **almost an active WordPress Plugin must to be registered in Sense** in order to register your Theme in Sense.



## Registering a Plugin

The first step to work with Sense in you Plugin is registering it, you can archive this in two simple steps:
 
1) First, you need to implement a class extending the Sense [AbstractPlugin](https://github.com/Simettric/Sense/blob/master/AbstractPlugin.php) class:

    
    // wp-content/plugins/your-plugin/your-plugin.php
     
    class YourSensePlugin extends \Simettric\Sense\AbstractPlugin{
         
        function getConfigLocations() {
            return array( __DIR__ . '/Config' );
        }
       
        function getControllerLocations() {
            return array( __DIR__ . '/Controller'  );
        }
       
        function getName() {
            return 'your-plugin-name';
        }
   	
   	}
   	
By default, Sense will assume that you have this directory structure in your theme or plugin:

    /your_plugin_or_theme_folder
    ----/Config
    -------/services.yml
    ----/Controller
    ----/View
   	
There are some special methods you can overwrite in order to configure and customize your plugin or theme directory structure: 

| Method name              	    | Default value 	| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	|
|--------------------------	    |---------------	|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| isTheme()                	    | false         	| Determine if your plugin is a WordPress Plugin or a WordPress Theme. Sense will threat both WordPress concepts as a Sense Plugin. **Important notice**: WorPress Themes have some limitations and Sense needs almost one active WordPress Plugin registered as a Sense Plugin. 	|
| getConfigLocations()     	    | /Config       	| An array of directories where the services.yml file are located. **Important notice**: you need to have a services.yml file in them or Sense will throw an Exception.                                                                                                       	|
| getControllerLocations() 	    | /Controller   	| An array of directories where the controllers are located.                                                                                                                                                                                                              	|
| getTemplateLocations()   	    | /Views        	| An array of directories where the template files are located.                                                                                                                                                                                                           	|
| registerPluggableFunctions() 	| void          	| You can implement here your custom [WordPress pluggable functions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Pluggable_Functions). Not available to WordPress themes. 



2) Then, you need to register this class in your pluginÂ´s main file:

    
    // wp-content/plugins/your-plugin/your-plugin.php
     
    class YourSensePlugin extends \Simettric\Sense\AbstractPlugin {
         
         [...]
   	}
   	
   	$sense = \Simettric\Sense\Kernel::getInstance();
    
    $sense->getContainer()
          ->get("plugin_manager")
          ->register(new YourSensePlugin(), __FILE__ );
   	

Note the second **__FILE__** argument. This argument must to be the path of your WordPress Plugin main file [where the headers are configured](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/the-basics/header-requirements/) or the WordPress Theme functions file.

## Instalation

Sense is designed to work with Composer. 

If you are not acquainted with the use of [WPackagist](https://wpackagist.org/) with Composer for WordPress, we encourage the use of [our WordPress composer base installation](https://github.com/Simettric/wordpress-composer-installation).

That comes with best practices in order to maintain WordPress platforms using Composer and deploy your code to different environments.

    
## Initialize and configure the Sense Kernel

Once you have installed WordPress, you need to initialize Sense, you need to do this **in your wp-config.php, just before of the wp-settings.php require_once**

    //wp-config.php
     
    //IMPORTANT: it must initialized be BEFORE of the inclusion of wp-settings.php
    \Simettric\Sense\Kernel::init(array(
        "plugins_order" => array(
             "my_first_plugin", 
             "my_second_plugin", 
             "my_theme_plugin"
        )
    ));
     
    /** Sets up WordPress vars and included files. */
    require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');

## Configuration

At this time, Sense only have one global configuration parameter: the plugins_order parameter.
This parameter is used to customize the order in which your plugins and themes are registered in Sense.


## Sense Plugins

You can use Sense in your plugins and themes. Both can be registered as a Sense Plugin.

We will see how to register them in the next chapter.
